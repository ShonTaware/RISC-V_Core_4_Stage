# 4-stage RISC-V Core

## Introduction To RISC-V ISA
RISC-V is a new ISA that's available under open, free and non-restrictive licences. RISC-V ISA delivers a new level of free, extensible software and hardware freedom on architecture.

### Why RISC-V?
  - Far simple and smaller than commercial ISAs.
  - Avoids micro-architecture or technology dependent features.
  - Small standard base ISA.
  - Multiple Standard Extensions.
  - Variable-length instruction encoding
