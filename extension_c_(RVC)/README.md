# 4-stage RISC-V Core
  - This repository contains the logic for decompression of a compressed 16-bit instruction used in the RISC-V extension 'C', also known as RVC.
  - It is developed in [TL-Verilog](http://tl-x.org/) using [Makerchip](https://makerchip.com/).
  - To be verify the decompression and decoder logic, inputs instruction were provided to the logic manually.
